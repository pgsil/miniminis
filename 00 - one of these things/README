00 - One of these things is not like the others

I tried to clone that game in the shortest time possible... and it shows.
It's playable, but I didn't bother making the colors anything but purely random, and the odd color can be really really hard to spot at times.
The CSS is terrible and it doesn't scale well to larger/smaller screens.
But the goal was achieved: it only took me a few minutes to make this, so yay!

By the way, my best score is 41! :D
