01 - calc

A lot of people make calculators soon after hello world. I had never made a calculator before this one.
The goal was making a calculator that worked like Windows 10's. That means that I had to code in a lot of scenarios (like type of the last button pressed, etc).
It seems to work!

If you press 2, PLUS, 2, EQUAL, the screen will display the result, 4.
If you press EQUAL again, the expected result is the screen displaying 6, because it repeats the last operation (PLUS 2).

Then there's the OPERATOR behaviors.
If you press 2 and PLUS, and then press MINUS, the screen will display "2-". If you then press MULTIPLY, the screen displays "2*" as intended.
If you press 2, PLUS and 2, the screen displays "2-2". If you then press PLUS, the screen will do the operation (2-2 = 0), and display "0+", as intended.

A few observations:
• I did use .eval(). I didn't want to look at how people made calculators before this miniproject, but I did afterwards and apparently a lot of people dislike .eval() for many different reasons.
I could probably rewrite this without the use of .eval(), which I might do soon. This was fun, not using .eval() will probably be even more fun!
• It's preeeeetty verbose. Sure, I wanted it to be very readable, but still, I'm fairly confident that this could be much shorter.
• I didn't have time for a decimal button!
