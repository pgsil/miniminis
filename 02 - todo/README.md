02 - todo

[TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) is a super cool project that compares different JS frameworks by making the same todo app in all of them. I thought it'd be cool to make my own version of a todo app, and it was! Using local storage is neat.

For this project I didn't want to use anything but normal JS.
