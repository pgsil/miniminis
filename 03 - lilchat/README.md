03 - lilchat

I wanted to make something using Node/Express again. So I made a chat.

Front-end is React, backend is Node/Express. Simple!
I'm using a mock JSON database. Node will just read and write to it.

Do `npm install` at `/03 - lilchat/` and at `/03 - lilchat/client`. Do a `npm start` at `/03 - lilchat/` and then at `/03 - lilchat/client`. Open `localhost:3001` (or whatever port React's running at) to open the client.
